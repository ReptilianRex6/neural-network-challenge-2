### In this challenge, I built a neural network model to predict employee attrition. The dataset contains various features about employees and whether they have left the company or not.

The model features contain the following columns:

- Age

- YearsSinceLastPromotion

The target column is:

- Attrition
- Department

The model consists of 7 layers:
